I am currently a postodoctoral researcher at Stanford University. I study the interaction between language and human cognition. More broadly, I am interested in how Psychology and Philosophy can help us understand reality, and the extent to which this understanding can be articulated in language.

Typical scholarly writing builds on a balanced account of the state of the art. In this blog, I start, rather, from my most immediate intuitions, put them into words, and only then connect these thoughts to the litterature that I am familar with. 

If you want to share with me your thoughts, comments, suggestions, or if you have a question, please send me an [email](mailto:abdellah.fourtassi@gmail.com).
