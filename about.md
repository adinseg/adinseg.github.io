I am currently a postodoctoral researcher at Stanford University. I study the interaction between language and human cognition. More broadly, I am interested in how Psychology and Philosophy can help us understand reality, and the extent to which this understanding can be articulated in language. 

### This blog:
Unlinke the typical scholarly writing that I practive in my research, this blog does not purport to build on a balanced account of the state of the art. Rather, I start from my most immediate intuitions, put them into words, and only then compare them with the litterature that I am aware of in Psychology, Philosophy or linguisitcs.
