I am currently a postodoctoral researcher at Stanford University. I study the interaction between language and human cognition. More broadly, I am interested in how Psychology and Philosophy can help us understand reality, and the extent to which this understanding can be articulated in language. 

# This blog
Typical scholarly writing builds on a balanced account of the state of the art. I practice this type of writing in my research. However in this blog, I start from my most immediate intuitions, put them into words, and only then connect them to the litterature that I am familar with in Philosophy or the natural sciences. 

If you want to share with me your thoughts, comments, suggestions, or if you have a question, please send me an [email](mailto:abdellah.fourtassi@gmail.com).
